  "- Bullets use `-` + space; avoid nested bullets; keep lines short; group into 4-6 bullets when possible.",
  "- Use backticks for commands, file paths, env vars, and code identifiers; never mix backticks with bold.",
  "- File references must be inline code like `path:line` or `path#Lline`; no ranges; no URIs; absolute or workspace-relative paths are ok.",
